## Latest Release

### v4.0.1 - Released 06/10/2025

This is a maintenance release that addresses critical bugs related to application stability and connection handling, and introduces a new quality-of-life feature for a smoother user experience.

#### **New Features**

*   **Manual Connection Retry:** In the event of a failed connection attempt, a "Retry" button will now be displayed. This allows users to attempt to reconnect immediately without having to restart the application or the connection process.

#### **Bug Fixes and Improvements**

*   **Application Stability:** Resolved a major bug where the "Quit" button would become unresponsive, preventing users from closing the application correctly. The application now exits as expected.
*   **Connection Reliability:** Addressed several issues within the connection API to significantly improve the stability and success rate of remote connections. This change reduces the likelihood of connection timeouts and unexpected disconnections.

We recommend all users update to this version to benefit from these improvements. Thank you for using Remote Manager
